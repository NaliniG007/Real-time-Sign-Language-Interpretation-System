## Abstract
One of the most precious gifts of nature to the human race is the ability to express itself by responding to the events that occur in its environment. Every normal person sees, hears, and then reacts to the situations by expressing himself. But there are some less lucky ones who are deprived of this precious gift. Such people, especially deaf and mute, rely on some sort of gesture language to communicate their feelings to others. The deaf, dumb and the blind follow similar problems when it comes to the use of computers. In the era of advanced technologies, where computers, laptops and other processor-based devices are an integral part of everyday life, efforts must be made to make the disabilities in life more independent. Our goal is to design a human computer interface system that can accurately identify the language of the deaf and dumb. With the use of image processing and artificial intelligence, many techniques and algorithms have been developed in this area. Each character speech recognition system is trained to recognize the characters and convert them into the required pattern. The proposed system aims to give speech speechless, a real-time character language is captured as a series of images, and it is processed and then converted into speech and text.

## Technologies Used
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing

## Existing System
Two Way Communicator between Deaf and Dumb People and Normal People.
Sign Language Recognition System to aid Deaf-dumb People Using PCA.
Sign Language to Text and Vice Versa Recognition using Computer Vision.

## Proposed System
This paper describes the system that overcomes the problem faced by the speech and hearing impaired. The objectives of the research are as follow: 
1. To design and develop a system which lowers the communication gap between speech hearing impaired and normal world. 
2. To build a communication system that enables communications between deaf-dumb person and a normal person. 
3. A convolution neural network is being used to develop a model that is trained on various hand movements. This model is used to create an app. This programme allows deaf and hard of hearing persons to communicate using signs that are then translated into human readable text.
